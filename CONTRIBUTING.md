# Contributing to KnutOS

When contributing to KnutOS, it is important that the changes you wish to make are in line with the project direction. If you are not sure about this, use GitHub Discussions, so we can talk about your ideas.

For your first pull request, start with something small to get familiar with the project and its development processes.

**NOTE: I would be very glad if someone could help me get the PIT to work or test 5-level paging (as QEMU isn't capable of it) :)**

## Coding style

It is also important that the coding style is the same across the whole project. Because of that, we make use of the syntax formatting tool [Artistic Style](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/).

It is expected that you run this tool before committing; the command can be conveniently invoked using ```make format```. The package "astyle" must be installed in order for that to work.

Commits which have not done this will be rejected.

## Comments

The next important thing is that your code must be documented with short and consise comments.

## Copyright headers

We greatly appreciate your contributions, however you must understand that a `[fix] typo` commit cannot be credited in the copyright header.

- If you have made a *significant* contribution place your name (`Prename Name <https://github.com/Username/>`) next to the `Contributer(s)` field where it says `foo`. If this filed doesn't exist, please create it.
Multiple contributers should be separated by commas and a newline may be inserted where the list gets too lengthy (if you have to scroll sideways to see your name).
If a newline has been inserted please indent it with 1 tab of the length of 4 spaces

- What does and doesn't qualify for you to place your name in the `Contributer(s)` field:
  - Does: Fixing a security bug, adding some new notable feature (emphasis on notable), or a nasty bug (something that has a very negative impact on the kernel/OS such as a corruption of xyz due to faulty code)

  - Doesn't: Fixing a typo, correcting a constant, adding variables, refactoring code, adding minor features (a minor feature would be something like a utility function or a wrapper function)

## Commiting

Now that you have followed all of the rules mentioned earlier, you are ready to commit. But it is important to know how.

First of all, split your work into logically seperated commits.

Then describe the commit as short and consise as possible in the commit message. They have to follow the following structure:

```[new] short and consise description``` for new features

```[fix] short and consise description``` for stuff that you had to change in order to make something work

```[refactor] short and consise description``` for stuff that you changed in order to make it better

```[doc] short and consise description``` for changes in the documentation

## Communication

In case you have any questions or desires about/for the project, please use GitHub Discussions to talk to us.
